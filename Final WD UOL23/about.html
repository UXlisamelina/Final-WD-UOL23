                        <p>Melina, founder of Good Day Moms has had several titles over the course of her life, however, she is most proud of the following; mom, personal chef, private tutor, and domestic engineer, which have been acquired over the past almost two decades. Parenting is an individual and extremely unique experience as no two children are alike; hence, for Melina being a mom represented a journey of self-discovery and sacrificial generosity for the benefit of the young minds in her care.</p>
          
                        <p>While very fulfilling - being a mother is also very challenging, and as such Melina questioned the status quo - she refused to accept that change will come if she repeated the mistakes of the past. Growing up in an environment where affection for children was not a norm and the lines of demarcation between discipline/abuse were not clearly defined, she strived for a meaningful and memorable experience. To this end, Melina started the research process so that she could ensure her children were getting the best academic, emotional, and psychological support she could offer while creating wonderful memories for a lifetime.</p>
          
                        <p>The empowerment of youth has also been a cause that is very close to her heart and in 2004, Melina conceptualized and partnered with the Ministry of Health, under a former Minister of Health for the national “It Can’t Happen to Me” campaign. This project was borne out of a two-month camp hosted by Melina for teenagers to reduce the incidence of teen pregnancy. With the support of PAHO and the Ministry of Health, thousands of brochures about Teen Pregnancy were distributed throughout Trinidad.</p>
          
                        <p>Melina, also the founder of The VIP Project, started the VIP Project to honor the memory of the many children, who lost their lives prematurely because of abuse. After reflecting on the birth of her first child, her own childhood, and her interaction with students as a former Information Technology teacher Melina believed there was a need to raise the awareness of Child Abuse, while gently reminding the public that our children are Very Important Persons. As a result, the first VIP Campaign with the slogan “Love our Children, Expose Abuse, Stop the Cycle", was launched in 2005.</p>
          
                        <p>Over the past almost two decades, Melina has dedicated her time and effort to the annual VIP Campaign which has grown from the distribution of Brochures about Child Abuse to the annual distribution of the VIP Family Life Magazine. Recently, Melina was instrumental in scripting and producing a companion TV Program-Coffee, Tea, and VIP, which was aired as a TV Series on CNC3. For Melina, the journey has not been easy, but it was well worth it.</p>
          
                        <p>As Melina continues to delve deeper into the nuances of parenthood and human behavior through applied psychological research, parenting experiences, and the use of technology - she looks forward to the continued sharing of her acquired knowledge and experiences in support of mothers via "Good Day Moms".  The journey would not have been possible without numerous collaborations and as such Melina remains most thankful to the businesses and individuals, who over the years have supported her efforts toward making a difference in the lives of many families and by extension “The Next Generation”.</p>
