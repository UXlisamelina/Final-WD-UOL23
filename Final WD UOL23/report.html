            <div class="highlights">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Good Day Moms was designed to disseminate information, inspiration and encouragement to mothers. This was inspired by real life events - during the pandemic. As a private tutor, I was hearing from many moms about the discouragement being faced and as such I started a facebook page/group to provide daily inspiration to moms for approximately one year. By the time the project came to an end, the page had amassed approximately 4000 followers and an email listing for sending out weekly articles. All the text and video content for the website was previously researched and created by me for my pandemic project. This project was a great opportunity to be of service to others during a time of uncertainty known as lock-down.</p>
                
                <p>The website layout was designed using the hierarchical structure, in an effort to organize the pages according to their importance. The homepage being the most significant page was placed at the top. The sitemap is attached in the Appendices below. The project required the design of five pages,so my website includes the following based on the sitemap:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Level 1 - Home Page</li>
                    <li>Level 2 - About, Family</li>
                    <li>Level 3 - Navigating Motherhood, Raising Intelligent Kids</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While each page is unique, they all follow a consistent theme -using specific colors based on the logo. The header, navigation bar and the footer are uniform across all five pages. The pages are all responsive and the layout flows seamlessly between desktop and mobile versions. Sample Home Page display in Appendices below.</p>
                <hr>
                
                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>The concept for Good Day Moms was inspired by moms facing uncertainty during the pandemic while having to stay strong in the face of adversity. As a mom of two teenagers, I believed that keeping the focus on our role would help us to come out on the other side of the pandemic in a much better place. It was not an easy situation, however, if we could encourage and support each other, our children would also be able to tap into their own strengths through our unwavering example.</p>
                
                <p>My inspiration for the building of the website came from my interaction with two websites; Walmart and BBC News. I particularly liked the Walmart Navigation Menu, which when clicked, did not have a drop down menu, but immediately took you to a category page. This concept was implemented in the design of the Family Page. Also inspiring were the uncluttered designs of the BBC website. In designing all the pages I tried to ensure that enough white space was present, while keeping the design minimalistic with bright images to capture the attention of my audience. A sample of the original wireframes for both mobile and desktop (Home Page) are displayed in Appendices below.</p>
                <hr>
                
                <h2>Accessibility</h2>
                <p>To facilitate accessibility throughout the website, all images have alt text descriptions, for the visually impaired. The use of varying levels of h tags have also been implemented to signify the importance levels of text associated ith a particular tag - h1 being most important, h4 being least important. For members of the audience who may not be able to play the video out loud or who have experienced hearing loss, transcripts have been included to ensure the content is available immediately.</p>
                
                <p>The color theme of the website features contrast between colours to facilitate persons who may be coping with color blindness. Text font-size was also selected to provide maximum legibility. The sizing of rows, columns and buttons in the design process was implemented to ensure that no matter the size of the device all content would be uncluttered and easy to navigate for individuals who may have limited fine motor skills.</p>
                <hr>
                
                <h2>Usability</h2>
                <p>In designing the site for maximum usability, consideration was given to responsiveness across devices, so that the content would be formatted to fit the screen size for all users. I also wanted a good user flow across pages, hence the home page can be accessed by tapping or clicking the logo in the header and footer of each page. A View More feature on each page, also takes a user who is casually browsing, on a preset journey and allows that user to experience a sampler of what the site has to offer.</p>
                
                <p>The articles and its design is also meant to be quite meaningful, while taking the user on an information expedition, so that they can be inspired and encouraged on their own motherhood journey. The articles are real-world and I felt that this would add value to the reader and their families as the information is well researched and can be applied to make a difference in the life of the reader and by extension to the benefit of the next generation.</p>
                <hr>
                
                <h2>Learning</h2>
                <p>To build the website, I had to learn how to create a hamburger menu. I was able to accomplish this by using the teaching provided by W3Schools. At first it was a challenge, but eventually I was able to grasp the implementation and customize the design for implementation on my website.</p>
                
                <p>During this process I also learned how to disable buttons which were within the spectrum of my design but were placeholders as the project was limited to five pages. While attempting to disable, I also struggled with removing the underline from the active buttons as well. Ultimately again thanks to W3Schools, I was able to figure it all out.</p>
                
                <p>I also had to learn how to create the pop up transcript, which I wanted to execute for accessibility purposes. I was able to again utilize W3Schools to learn how to implement my transcript feature. It was a bit of a hurdle to ensure that both my transcript buttons were working flawlessly, but again I was determined to ensure it was accomplished.</p>
                <hr>
                
                <h2>Evaluation 1</h2>
                <p>The aspects I believe were successful include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>The application of the favicon to all pages, as it adds a professional touch</li>
                <li>Using shadows to create a 3D effect to my rows and columns which adds more depth to the main pages</li> 
                <li>Implementing the hover effect on the active call to action buttons</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Throughout this process, the learning curve was steep. My use of Javascript allowed me to implement the transcript and hamburger menu, which definitely elevates the design for greater usability. I believe that on the site I was able to combine HTML, CSS and JavaScript to tell the story of my website effectively.</p>
                <hr>
                
                <h2>Evaluation 2</h2>
                <p>Given another opportunity to build a website, I now understand the importance of the size of assets like images. During the mockup phase, I selected images, which at the time I thought would be feasible. The hero image was originally 1300 x 300 px in the mockup, however, this was was not adapting well to mobile and the size was changed to 1280 x 720 px. The original size was not visually appealing across screen sizes. Hence going forward, I would do some more research about images, so that I can become better at using these assets effectively. Mockup comparison is displayed in the Appendices below.</p>
                
                <p>I am now more mindful of transcripts for accessibility, therefore when producing videos in the future, it is important to keep the scripts properly stored, as it would allow for the transcript to be uploaded. When I originally produced these videos, transcripts were not a consideration and unfortunately I was unable to locate the text file, used for production. I would have preferred to used the actual transcript as opposed to placeholder text.</p>
