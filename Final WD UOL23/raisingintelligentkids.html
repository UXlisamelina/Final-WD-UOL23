            <p>Intelligence has been the subject of the learned and the unlearned for decades. For many mothers, this issue of acquiring knowledge can be the cause of many sleepless nights for both parent and child. On average children will spend 12-15 years in a formalized education setting for the purpose of learning, or even 20+ years from "Pre-School to Ph.D.".</p>
            
            <p>Intelligence is defined as the mental capacity to acquire knowledge, which can then be used to reason, plan and solve problems instead of doing things by one's natural impulse. This definition can lead to the conclusion that as a society we need intelligent farmers, writers, engineers, tailors and teachers etc. who have acquired the necessary knowledge to complete their respective jobs successfully. Harvard Psychologist Howard Gardner proposed the concept of multiple intelligences, which challenged traditional beliefs in the fields of education. The multiple intelligences include:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Visual-Spatial learners e.g., Architects, Engineers who think primarily in terms of pictures and can learn complex concepts quickly and generate unusual solutions to problems.</li>
            <li>Linguistic-Verbal learners e.g., Teachers, Lawyers who can use words effectively both in writing and speaking.</li>
            <li>Logical-Mathematical learners e.g., Accountants, Computer Programmers who can recognize patterns and logically analyze problems.</li>
            <li>Bodily-Kinesthetic learners e.g., Athletes, Actors who possess excellent hand-eye coordination.</li>
            <li>Musical learners e.g., Musicians, Singers who are good at thinking in rhythms and sounds.</li>
            <li>Interpersonal learners, e.g., Psychologists, Politicians who can communicate well with others and understand and interact with different people.</li>
            <li>Intrapersonal learners e.g., Writers, Scientists who tend to be self-aware and enjoy self-reflection.</li>
            <li>Naturalistic Learners e.g., Farmers, Biologists who are often interested in nurturing and exploring the environment.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Based on Howard Gardner's approach, there is a place in society for everyone. No one career path is better than the other. Can you imagine a world without the arts or a hospital without nurses? Each individual's service is valuable, no matter where it falls on the pay scale. Imagine for a moment - living in a home where there was no water or electricity - yet because these workers don't wear suits, their careers are not seen as prestigious. </p>
            
            <p>The application of intelligence, as noted by Gardner, requires an attempt to find our innate strengths and then craft a future for ourselves. The goal then during motherhood is to assist our children to become excellent service providers by acquiring the knowledge needed to serve with intelligence.</p>
            
            <p>Intelligence is not a fixed or a limited resource, according to Carol Dweck, a Psychology Professor at Stanford University. Dweck formally held the belief that one was either intelligent or not; however, her subsequent research led her to conclude that intelligence is developed through effort. Her studies further demonstrated that teaching young students how the brain is capable of change when faced with challenges, helped students persevere and develop a growth mindset.</p>                              
                   
            
            <p>She indicated that "In the growth mindset, people believe that their talents and abilities can be developed through passion, education, and persistence. For them, it's not about looking smart or grooming their image. It's about a commitment to learning - taking informed risks and learning from the results, surrounding yourself with people who challenge you to grow, looking frankly at your deficiencies, and seeking to remedy them."</p>

            <p>Learning is not an easy task, and for some students, a learning disability might be a challenge. A learning disability is a neurological disorder affecting the brain, which inhibits the individualâ€™s capacity to process and retain information.</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Dyslexia - a language-based disability in which a person has trouble understanding written words. It may also be referred to as a reading disorder or reading disability.</li>
            <li>ADHD - Students who have ADHD have difficulty paying attention and staying on task. These students can be easily distracted and often have trouble in traditional school settings.</li>
            </ul>  
            
            <p>Children with a learning disability are not lazy, stupid, or dumb. Their brains are wired differently. Their success in learning depends on the adults around them, finding methods that are tailored to their uniqueness. If you suspect that your child has a learning disability, it is advisable to have your child evaluated by a clinical psychologist. Early detection can result in your child getting the necessary support and tools to ensure future success. Praising your child's effort as opposed to their ability can be a good source of encouragement.</p>
            
            <p>Intelligence is a valuable asset to human existence. In understanding the innate capability of our children, as mothers, we can gain immeasurable insight into the way they learn, so as to assist them in further developing their intelligence. In today's environment, we are bombarded with information daily, competing for the most precious resource-our attention. Helping our students to develop the ability to regulate and manage their focus is important. Intelligence is not fixed or limited. Intelligence can be gained with the right tools and support. While it may not be an easy task, persistence, and diligence will achieve success.</p>
