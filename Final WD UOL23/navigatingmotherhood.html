        <div class="news-article1">
                    
                   
            <p>In the world of civil engineering, a bridge is used as a remedy to overcome an obstruction to facilitate the passage of people and vehicles. Bridges are structures engineered to withstand natural and human elements and can withstand the test of time. Parenting is like building a bridge, as it requires parents to engineer a path through life’s obstacles to take a child from the point of conception over to the point of adulthood.</p>
            
            <p>While building bridges may require concrete and steel for stability, the bridge to a stable society requires domestic engineers aka mothers, based in homes all over the world skilled in the adequate use of protection and provision for their offspring. These resources, used in effective combinations, can overcome or eliminate a myriad of hindrances along a child’s journey to a stable future.</p>
            
            <p>The safety of children is paramount to their existence, hence, for the duration of gestation,  health professionals advise pregnant women against ingesting - illegal drugs, tobacco, and alcohol. These are especially harmful to the growing foetus; resulting in birth defects, growth retardation, or developmental delays, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  Immunization which starts in the early stages of life and goes all the way into adulthood is deemed as protection from communicable diseases.</p>
            
            <p>For moms, it is pertinent to understand the purpose of various vaccines and consult with health professionals to ensure the protection of our children from preventable diseases like polio and measles. Subsequent to the birth of the child, a safe home is essential to the growth and development of the minor. Outfitting the home with the required safety measures can prevent many avoidable accidents within the home such as burns, poisoning, and dangerous falls.</p>
            
            <p>While the school years are a time of curiosity for a child; teaching children how to respond to bullying and strangers both on/offline are valuable lessons for a child’s overall safety. As a teenager, personal independence is a natural part of inching closer to adulthood; however, a teen is still incapable of fully comprehending the results of some of their actions, because of the brain’s incomplete development, hence parental protection is still a must.</p>
            
            <p>Educating teens about their reproductive health and emotional/mental well-being is essential to their safety from their ignorance and predators. Ensuring that teens understand the long-term consequences of their actions and that there are individuals who will seek to prey on their immaturity can prove essential guardrails to prevent unwanted pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases/infections, and addictions to recreational drugs and alcohol.</p>

            <p>Another aspect of protecting a minor is proper supervision. Whether children are seven or seventeen, a lack of proper supervision can lead to disastrous consequences, being especially mindful of vulnerable children with special needs. As mothers whether in person or with support from others we should be aware of the whereabouts of our offspring, the company being kept, and the activities being undertaken. Never underestimate the role of supervision!</p>
            
            <p>Children are by nature very curious, and from a very tender age, we implement rules alongside the values we mean for them to uphold. Rules set limits to ensure the well-being of the child. Obedience protects children from danger. Children should be trained to have respect for our authority, as rules work more efficiently when kids understand the role and relationship of parental guidance.</p>
            
            <p>As human beings, we all have needs. The following are the needs of each individual: Spiritual, Emotional, Mental, and Physical. Most parents are adept are meeting the physical needs of a child as this requires tangible objects such as food, and clothing, which if not met is visible and easily recognized based on the appearance and behavior of the child.</p>
            
            <p>Apart from sustenance, physical activity is also paramount to the healthy development of our youngsters. As a child grows into a teen, it is important that we teach the significance of food and nutrition for optimal physical health, helping them to understand the various food groups and ideal portion sizes. The middle to late teens is an excellent time to teach the use of a recipe book and some basic kitchen/cooking skills for heading into adulthood as food preparation and physical education are significant life skills.</p>
            
            <p>Emotional and mental strength is also an aspect of a child’s development. To facilitate a child’s emotional well-being, children need to be taught that they have emotions and how to learn to control these emotions, for example; happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and jealousy. As stated by the clinical social worker and author, Amy Morin, developing mental strength is about improving your ability to regulate your emotions, manage your thoughts, and behave positively, despite your circumstances.</p>
            
            <p>Children in most cases cannot articulate their feelings and patience is essential, particularly during the teenage years when many physiological and hormonal changes are occurring. Listening to our children and respecting their emotions during this sometimes turbulent period can help to maintain peace in the home. Showing empathy and understanding will allow our children to build emotional intelligence, which is necessary for functioning in and out of the home.</p>

            <p>Intellectual development is crucial to survival in this world. During motherhood, how does one take a baby to adulthood along the track of academic/skill development? Well, it starts with teaching kids the alphabet and how to count. Without recognizing it, children are being taught how to use their memory to learn and gain knowledge. To be effective as moms, we can teach the skills of focus and memory/time management if kids are to acquire knowledge so they can become helpful and also contribute meaningfully to society.</p>
            
            <p>While in past times, the academic development of a child was left to the teachers at school, that child remains a member of a family and it is, therefore, our responsibility as a parent to prepare the child with a useful skill to be of service to self and others. Whether a child would like to be a seamstress, a carpenter, a nurse, or a doctor, these are all skills that require preparation. As a mother conversing with our children meaningfully about their future development will allow us to help them access the relevant intellectual development to succeed during adulthood, in their selected vocation.</p>
            
            <p>Spiritual development is essential to an individual’s holistic development. It is that dimension of our humanity that helps us to discover our purpose for existing, besides our values and beliefs. Spiritual development and organized religion are not the same. Encyclopedia Britannica states that the Bible is the sacred scriptures of Judaism and Christianity, while according to Encyclopedia a religious organization is the complex of institutionalized roles and procedures which regulate the relations of men with the supernatural order, however, such an order may be conceived.</p>
            
            <p>Spiritual teaching would allow our offspring to find peace, hope, and comfort, during times of difficulty. It is important to teach children that we may not always understand or have a reason to explain some of life’s occurrences; however, we are all a minor part of a bigger puzzle. This allows us to have faith and hope when most needed. Since the point of raising children is to allow them to become independent adults, it is crucial that they understand and accept their spiritual dimension, as a parent will not always be present to be a guide. At that juncture, one’s purpose, values, and beliefs will become that compass.</p>
            
            <p> Effective parenting requires that we comprehend that we are building bridges to the future based on our ability to combine protection and provision. Providing for the needs of the child encompasses adequate supervision, making excellent decisions regarding child safety both in and out of the home, and the ability to educate ourselves regarding vaccination to prevent disease. </p>
            
            <p>Supplying the needs of a child is not just ensuring they have food on the table, but also looking out for their spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical development. The ability to be intentional about the provision and protection of our children will lend to a supportive environment that will enable the successful development of young adults with necessary life skills, suited to their talents and purpose. The result is an environment designed to surpass obstacles while using solid principles to build bridges for generations to come.</p>
